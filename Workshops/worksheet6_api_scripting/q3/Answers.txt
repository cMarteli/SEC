Q3

(a) Create CalendarDate.java, containing the declaration for this annotation type:

CalendarDate.java

This defines the CalendarDate annotation with the specified retention policy and target type.

(b) Write a Java program to find all methods in a given Java class (specified by the user) that have a @CalendarDate annotation:

This program takes the fully qualified class name as a command-line argument and uses reflection to find methods with the @CalendarDate annotation in the specified class.

(c) For each method, output the method name, and the day, month, and name annotation details:

The code in part (b) already accomplishes this. It prints the method name, day, month, and name annotation details for each method with the @CalendarDate annotation found in the specified class.

Provided is class named SampleCalendarEvents to test with.

Usage: 
javac *.java
java CalendarDateFinder SampleCalendarEvents
